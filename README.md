# Feedforward-Artifical-Neural-Network-for-Car-Sales-Prediction

This project aims to use a simple feedforward neural network to predict the price a customer is willing to pay for a car. 

Using a dataset with the following attributes

* Customer Name
* Customer e-mail
* Country
* Gender
* Age
* Annual Salary
